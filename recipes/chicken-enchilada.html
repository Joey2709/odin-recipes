    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>16 ounces elbow macaroni</li>
      <li>1 (10 ounce) can red enchilada sauce</li>
      <li>1 cup half-and-half</li>
      <li>1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chilies</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded pepperjack cheese</li>
      <li>2 cups cubed cooked chicken</li>
      <li>Â¼ cup chopped cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni
        in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to
        the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and set aside.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Combine enchilada sauce, half-and-half, and green chiles in the same pot
        over medium heat and cook until warm, 5 to 10 minutes. Slowly add
        Cheddar cheese and pepperjack cheese and whisk continuously until
        melted, about 5 minutes. Return cooked macaroni to the pot. Add chicken
        and cilantro and stir until combined and heated through, about 5 minutes
        more.
